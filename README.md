## Steps to follow the analysis
1) "1 - Data Cleaning"
2) "Claims report"  with "Insights" to go through exploratory analysis
3) "2 - Analysis" for additional insights
4) "3 - Prediction" for Paid Amount prediction

## Top 3 findings:
* Almost all top 10 categories showed fall except Ancillary (I'll assume that ancillar costs are not tied to number of patients)
* Almost all top 10 claim speliaties showed fall; hematology showed growth of 38% (COVID-19 is infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system)
* Top 4 Payers showed fall of 30-35% in paid amount; knowing the distributions of specialties by payer - F,O fall due to inp; CA,H - due to hospital
